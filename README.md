# Rustmail - Discord Modmail Bot (Rust)

[ ![discord-shield][] ][discord-invite]

---
A Discord modmail bot written in Rust that allows staff to manage support tickets via channels, with features like message editing, internationalization, structured error handling, and more.
The bot can operate in single-server or dual-server modes, supports SQLite for data storage, and offers a range of commands for staff to interact with users efficiently.

---
## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
This is my first major project in Rust; while I have solid experience in C and other languages, I'm learning Rust as I go — feedback and PRs are welcome.

Project documentation is currently being written.

---
> Status: **Public Alpha** – **NON PRODUCTION-READY** (unstable, API & schema subject to change, data loss risk). Use at your own risk.
>
> Goal: Provide a performant, extensible Rust modmail foundation with thread management, message editing, i18n, rich error system and future advanced features.

---
## Feature Summary (Currently Implemented)
- Open support ticket / staff⇄user thread (`!new_thread` or optional manual creation if enabled)
- **Single-server** or **dual-server (community + staff)** mode
- SQLite storage (threads, messages, staff alerts, blocked users)
- Incremental per-thread message numbering
- Staff replies → user DM + mirrored in thread channel
- Anonymous replies (`!anonreply` / `!ar`)
- Retroactive message editing (staff) with propagation & internal audit note (`!edit` / `!e`)
- Message deletion + renumbering (`!delete`)
- Controlled thread closing (`!close`) + forced orphan cleanup (`!force_close`)
- Scheduled closing with cancel and silent modes (see Thread Closing)
- Thread category moving with fuzzy matching (`!move` / `!mv`)
- Add/remove staff participants to a ticket (`!add_staff`, `!remove_staff`)
- Staff alert subscription with ping on next user activity (mentions + auto-clear on use)
- User/server membership awareness (e.g., user left server / not in community → system notice)
- Asynchronous recovery of missing messages (`!recover`)
- Typing proxy (user ↔ staff) configurable
- Configurable system messages (welcome / close)
- Configurable embed colors (user / staff / system) in hex
- Fine‑grained success/failure notification toggles
- Internationalization (multi-language + per-user preferences) – English & French shipped
- Structured error system (categorization, codes, TTL, auto-delete, translation)
- Error & language test commands (`!test_errors`, `!test_language`, `!test_all_errors`)
- In‑memory per-thread locks (basic race mitigation)
- Attachment download & relay
- Dynamic configuration validation (logs, features, Discord guild access)

---
## Architecture
- `main.rs`: Initialization (DB, config, Serenity client, handlers, guild validation)
- `config.rs`: Load + structural validation + dependency injection (pool, error handler)
- `handlers/`: Discord event listeners (messages, reactions, members, interactions, moderation, ready, typing proxy)
- `commands/`: Prefix command logic (manual parsing)
- `db/` & `db/operations/`: SQLx abstraction (SQLite) – threads, messages, features, alerts
- `modules/`: Functional logic (message recovery, thread helpers)
- `utils/`: Utility helpers (conversion, message builder, content extraction, time, locks)
- `i18n/`: Dictionary system + multi-language resolution + fallback
- `errors/`: Strongly typed errors, dictionary mapping → localized embeds
- `features/`: Optional / experimental modules (e.g. poll)

### Staff → User Reply Flow
1. Staff types `!reply` inside a thread channel
2. Parse content & attachments
3. Allocate message number (approx. atomic) → increment `next_message_number`
4. Send staff embed to thread + DM user
5. Persist in DB (`thread_messages`) with Discord IDs
6. Optional success notification

### Thread Closing
- `!close`: Final DM (if user still guild member), mark closed & delete channel
- Scheduled closing with delay and optional silent mode (no user DM)
- `!close cancel`: Cancel a scheduled closing (prevents pending closure)
- `!force_close`: Delete orphaned channel OR residual untracked inbox channel

### Message Editing
- `!edit <num> <new text>`: Validate rights (author/staff), fetch IDs, edit thread + DM messages, update DB
- System message (audit) indicates change with deep link to edited message

Notes:
- `move` uses Levenshtein matching (~50% distance threshold) on category names.

---
## Internationalization (i18n)
- Default + fallback language from config.
- Per-user preference via `!test_language <code>` (test command; a dedicated command could replace it later).
- Key namespaces: (reply.*, delete.*, new_thread.*, move.*, permission.*, success.*, close.*, alert.*, server.*, user.*, etc.).
- Missing translation → fallback language.

### Adding a Language
1. Create file in `src/i18n/language/<code>.rs`
2. Implement dictionary similar to `en.rs`
3. Add code to `supported_languages` + enum mapping

---
## Install & Run
### Prerequisites
- Rust (2024 edition toolchain) – see `rust-toolchain.toml`
- SQLite library (SQLx manages access)
- Create application + bot in [Discord Developer Portal]

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akinator31/rustmail.git
cd rustmail
cp config.example.toml config.toml
cargo run --release
```

### Critical Variables
- Keep `bot.token` secret (do not commit).
- Enable required privileged intents (MESSAGE CONTENT, GUILD MEMBERS, PRESENCES) in the developer portal.

---
## Roadmap
Not yet determined. See GitHub Project.

---
## Message Conventions
- Staff → `staff_message_color`
- User → `user_message_color`
- System / success / errors → `system_message_color` (or derivative)
- `block_quote = true` applies quoted styling depending on builder implementation

---
## Maintenance
- Backups: copy `db/db.sqlite`
- New migration → restart binary (sqlx applies at startup via `init_database()`)
- Logs: currently stdout/stderr (improve later)

---
## License
MIT. See LICENSE file.

---
## Contributions
Alpha phase: open descriptive issues (bugs, UX). PRs accepted after discussion.

---
## Final Disclaimer
Project is in **alpha**. APIs, structures, schemas and behaviors may change without backward compatibility. Do not use in critical environments or with sensitive data. Make frequent backups.
