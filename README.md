# Rustmail - Discord Modmail Bot (Rust)

[ ![discord-shield][] ][discord-invite]

---
A Discord modmail bot written in Rust that allows staff to manage support tickets via channels, with features like
message editing, internationalization, structured error handling, and more.
The bot can operate in single-server or dual-server modes, supports SQLite for data storage, and offers a range of
commands for staff to interact with users efficiently.

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This is my first major project in Rust; while I have solid experience in C and other languages, I'm learning Rust as I
go — feedback and PRs are welcome.

Project documentation is currently being written.
